- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fgkritsis, currently a PhD candidate @ Covestro GmbH, under the supervision of Christian Gogolin.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested mostly in Quantum computing for simulations in Quantum Chemistry, but not limited to exclusively that, 
  as I try to keep myself updated to other potential applications of quantum computing, even though chemistry is regarded as the most promising application
  for demonstrating quantum supremacy.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tools and platforms that allow me to do impactful research on the field of Quantum Computing, using Python. 
  Apart from professional growth, I am trying my hand at 3D printing and Robotics.
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: find me as @fgkritsis on twitter.
